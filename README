there are 3 executables you can make and run

gcd_gpu - our gpu implementation
gcd_cpu - our cpu version with our implemented mp functions
gcd_cpu_gmp - our cpu version using libgmp

to run just run the corresponding scripts:
run_gpu <keyfile> <output file (optional)
run_cpu <keyfile> <output file (optional)
run_cpu_gmp <keyfile> <output file (optional)

the scripts will make sure the program is compiled so you do not have to do any work.

sample run
./run_gpu <keyfile> broken_keys.out

this will compile and then run the gpu version on the specified keyfile and write the 
compromised keys from the keyfile as n:d into broken_keys.out
